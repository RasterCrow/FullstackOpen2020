# FullstackOpen2020
Repository for my exercises for the full stack open 2020 course from the University of Helsinki. I've decided to try and take part in this free course for full stack developer. I've never worked with React before, but I've always wanted to check it out.
If you want to take the course you can find it here :  https://fullstackopen.com/en
